Trailed Lights
==============

Wifi-connected jar lanterns.

This is an experiment / art project playing around with expectations. What do
you expect of a simple Ball jar lantern lining a trail in the woods at a burn?
It's likely just some cheap string lights and batteries. It may dim over time
as the batteries run out. The lights may not work at all, but hopefully someone
changed the batteries.

But what if they could interact with you?

These are Ball jar-based lanterns that are expected to last about 5 days on a
charge. They have ambient light sensors and motion detectors to help save power
and to allow interactions with people.
